Liron is a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in French linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin. In 2018, he received his bachelor's degrees in Integrative Biology and French from UC Berkeley. He spent a year after his undergraduate studies in Paris as an assistant de langue, teaching English in a French middle school. In 2021, Liron received his Masters in French Linguistics from UT Austin. He is also currently a graduate research assistant in the UT Neurolinguistics Lab. His research interests lie in French linguistics, psycholinguistics, and second language phonetics and phonology. His work primarily focuses on how individual variability in cognition and language background are predictive of non-native speech category learning of difficult French vowel contrasts.
